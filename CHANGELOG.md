## [0.13.2] - 2023-03-24

* `Runner::update_test_file` properly escapes regex special characters.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-03-16

* Support postgres options.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-02-15

* `sqllogictest-bin` now uses the strict validator to update records (the runner still doesn't check schema).
* The query syntax now allows optional columns (`query\n` without any column arguments).

## [0.12.0] - 2023-02-09

* customizable column types and validators

## [0.11.2] - 2023-02-09

* support multiple files as input in cli
* remove unnecessary debug

## [0.11.1] - 2023-01-15

* fix parsing for trailing comments

## [0.11.0] - 2023-01-14

This release contains some minor fixes.

* fix: use `Vec<Vec<String>>` for external engine (JDBC)
* fix: Use `lines()` instead of `split('\n')` in `parse_inner`. So the behavior can be correct on Windows.
* fix: parse DML with `returning` as a query
* A minor **breaking change**: `update_test_file` takes `&mut Runner` instead of its ownnership.

## [0.10.0] - 2022-12-15

- Improve the ability to unparse and update the test files. Mainly add `update_record_with_output` and `update_test_file` to the library. 

  More details:
  * Add `impl Display` for `Record` (refactor `unparse`).
  * Add `Record::Whitespace` so the whitespace in the original files can be reconstructed during `unparse`.
  * Add tests for unparsing and updating records.
  * Refactor and fix the behavior about newlines and `halt` for CLI options `--override` and `--format`.
- Fix: `hash-threshold` should be compared with the number of values instead of the number of rows.
- **Breaking change**: The type of `Validator` is changed from `fn(&Vec<String>, &Vec<String>) -> bool` to `fn(&[Vec<String>], &[String]) -> bool`. Also added a `default_validator`.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-12-07

- Improve the format and color handling for errors.
- Support `hash-threshold`.
- Fix `statement count <n>` for postgres engines.
- **Breaking change**: use `Vec<Vec<String>>` instead of `String` as the query results by `DB`. This allows the runner to verify the results more precisely.
  + For `rowsort`, runner will only sort actual results now, which means the result in the test cases should be sorted.
- **Breaking change**: `Hook` is removed.
- **Breaking change**: `Record` and parser's behavior are tweaked:
  + retain `Include` record when linking its content
  + keep parsing after `Halt`
  + move `Begin/EndInclude` to `Injected`
- Added CLI options `--override` and `--format`, which can override the test files with the actual output of the database, or reformat the test files.

## [0.8.0] - 2022-11-22
